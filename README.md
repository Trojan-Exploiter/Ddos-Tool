# Ddos Attack 


# What is a DDoS Attack?
A Distributable Denied-of-Service (DDOS) attack server that cuts off targets or surrounding infrastructure in a flood of Internet traffic

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness using multiple compromised computer systems as a source of attack traffic. Search engines may include computers and other network resources such as IoT devices. From a higher level, the DDOS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam stuck on a highway, preventing regular traffic from reaching its destination.
